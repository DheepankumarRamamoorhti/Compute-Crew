## Project Overview

This project addresses the challenge of efficiently summarizing large volumes of research articles through an AI-powered distributed computing solution. Our system leverages cutting-edge NLP technologies, combined with scalable computing frameworks to provide fast, customizable, and accurate summaries.

---

## Key Features

- **AI Summarization:** Uses NLP models (GPT-4, BART-large-CNN).
- **Custom Summaries:** Allows users to refine and personalize AI-generated summaries.
- **Real-time Aggregation:** Integrates APIs from Semantic Scholar, arXiv, PubMed, and performs web scraping.
- **Scalable Infrastructure:** Utilizes Apache Kafka, Redis, Kubernetes, and Docker for efficient and scalable real-time processing.
